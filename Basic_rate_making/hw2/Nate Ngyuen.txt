- Presenters introduced themselves.
Had a contents page & overview of topic
I like the example of how insurance works and the timeline.
Its as if the authors make no assumptions about the background
about the viewer.

Chain Ladder Method:
- Example of loss triangle
- I like the xample of the explanation of the loss triangle.
- Confirmed the assumption of the chain ladder method. 
- I like the listing of the steps, but it would have been helpful
  to have a visualization.

Good example and explanation.
